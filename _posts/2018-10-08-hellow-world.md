## There are tech blogs and there are lifestyle blogs...

...but there aren't many tech + lifestyle blogs!

It's so common as to be cliché, but everything started to change for me with the 2016 election. At first, I followed the mounting polarization with rapt attention and the requisite bursts of outrage, but outrage is exhausting. I attended some local political activism gatherings, but maybe they weren't the right ones; people began talking about the potential for violence, and I was scared away. As my friends also grew tired of discussing politics and current events, my outrage slowly turned into a fire without an oxygen source and started to burn itself out.  

I found myself spending more and more time reading 'lifestyle' articles as a distraction from the dismal headlines. Eventually, I transitioned from seeing this as a guilty pleasure to embracing it as a return to where my focus _should be_ – finding joy in day-to-day life. 

I started reading articles on major websites and small-time blogs alike, in order to learn how others went about their everyday lives and extract lessons for my own. If art helps us tackle the big questions of the human condition, I believe that _lifestyle_ is for all of the little ones. I found that my heady liberal arts cirriculum from college had left me with a pegboard of holes for life's little questions, and I became very earnest about trying to fill them.

I work as a data analyst, so I am comfortable writing code and leveraging technology to make my life easier. It felt natural that I should try to implement home automation techniques, but established lifestyle sites stopped far short of addressing lifestyle tech. [Most blogs in the area](https://blog.feedspot.com/home_automation_blogs/) were written by companies promoting their smart home products or read like tech blogs providing industry news. 

I found the [home automation subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/) to be the best resource available, but I was turned off by the implicit sexism of terms like _"Wife Acceptance Factor"_:

> One final concept to keep in mind is the WAF - the Wife Acceptance Factor. Depending on political correctness, this can also be called the Spousal Acceptance Factor, kid-proofing, guest-proofing, or foolproofing. Depending on your living and family situation, you should put effort into making your system welcoming to others. Otherwise, you face risks running from guests messing up your carefully constructed programming to being defunded at the next family budget meeting.

While the concept of foolproofing is important, the tone here assumes that the person doing the automating is a man and creates an unwelcoming environment for women. Even with the nod to equality by mentioning gender neutral alternatives, it's made clear that this is a male-dominated space.

What I most wanted to see was smart home topics integrated into broader lifestyle sites. Technology is becoming an ever larger part of our lives, and yet we still treat it as apart from the minutiae of the day-to-day. Why should setting up a new internet of things device or coding up a custom script to automate an everyday task be thought of differently from any other DIY job? 

My goal with this site is to talk about lifestyle while embracing technology as a key resource available to us in improving our lives. 


## Empowering myself and others

As I noted with the _"Wife Acceptance Factor"_, many tech spaces can project an environment that is unwelcoming to women. I greatly admire women's networks that have emerged to empower women in the [tech industry](https://www.womenintechnology.org) and the [workplace in general](http://www.ladiesgetpaid.com). I cannot count the number of times I have seen a job posting and labeled myself as lacking the requisite skills, when I really just lacked the confidence to value my skills appropriately. I am trying to get better with this. 

I also cannot count the number of times that I tried to talk myself out of starting this site, asking myself what I could possibly say that isn't out there already and which others couldn't say better. But I am going to do it anyway. 

Maybe there are others out there that want to talk about using technology to improve their day-to-day lives and haven't found a good space to do so. Maybe there are others that will be inspired to find their own voice and share their unique ways of doing things. Even if something has been said before, the world is constantly changing and society constantly needs new commentary and discussion about what is still relevant: it is important that we all feel empowered to join in that conversation.  


## What's with the site name?

My husband is from Austria, so many of our dinner table conversations with his family center on cultural differentces between the U.S. and his home country. My mother-in-law once said that she thought the biggest difference between Austria and the U.S. was the pervasive feeling of _Gemütlichkeit_ in Austria. Especially in Vienna, she felt that everyone took the time to slow down and appreciate the cozy atmosphere with friends and family, while Americans seemed to her to have a culture of rushed busyness. We were sitting in a courtyard cafe in the historical district of Vienna, and as I looked around at the ornate buildings and the quiet plaza that formed an oasis off of the busy thoroughfare, I couldn't help but agree.

Several months later I was taken back to this conversation when I came upon [a post on Apartment Therapy](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/german-word-new-hygge-quality-time-meaning-259093) highlighting the concept of gemütlichkeit. I took this as a sign that gemütlichkeit was in the running to be the [next German loanword to go mainstream](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/german/german-words-in-english/), and since I had already been thinking of starting a lifestyle site, I decided to register gemütlichkeit as my domain name. As a technical note, browsers and servers can have issues with the ü character, so this has been changed to ue in the main domin name, as is common for German language websites. The main domain name is therefore gemuetlichkeit.io with gemütlichkeit.io and the anglicized gemutlichkeit.io being redirected to the main domain name.

[Wikipedia refers to gemütlichkeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemütlichkeit) as "a state or feeling of warmth, friendliness, and good cheer", encompassing other feelings such as "coziness, peace of mind, and a sense of belonging and well-being springing from social acceptance". The .io in the domain name refers to the tech element of this site. In computer science, I/O is an abbreviation for input/output, so [many tech-oriented websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io) and companies use the .io top level domain. 

Many of us want to live a life that is warm and cozy, filled with quality time with friends and family, but we have to figure out what that looks like in the modern world and technology will be an important part of it. Given the large cognitive load of modern life, we need to maximize our energy for the important things by making the less important things as smooth and easy as possible. This is what I hope to discuss here.
